# Tek7904ALedGraticule
A project to retro-fit LED graticule lighting to Tektronix 7904A scopes.

Inspired by the white LED upgrade to a [Tek 7854 by Zenwizard Studios](https://youtu.be/GYkjuE7Pez8).

The 7904A is not so so straightforward that you can simply replace the lamps with LEDs and a series resistor.

This design replaces the existing incandescent graticule lamp driver circuit with a variable current source, all the existing controls are honoured, including intensity, gate and manual modes.
